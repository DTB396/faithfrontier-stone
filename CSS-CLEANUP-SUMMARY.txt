CSS CLEANUP SUMMARY - 2025-12-21

FOUND:
- 1,876 defined classes
- 604 actively used classes
- 1,483 unused classes (79%)

- 176 defined CSS variables
- 150 actively used variables
- 34 unused variables (19%)

RECOMMENDATION:
Many unused classes appear to be:
1. Utility classes (bg-dark, text-light, etc.)
2. Component variants (btn--primary, badge--success)
3. Future-ready classes (coming-soon, future-feature)
4. Build artifacts in _site folder

SAFE TO REMOVE:
- Exclude _site folder from count (build artifacts)
- Focus on truly orphaned component styles
- Keep utility classes for consistency

NEXT STEPS:
1. Review css-audit-report.json
2. Identify safe removal candidates
3. Test after removal
4. Commit changes
