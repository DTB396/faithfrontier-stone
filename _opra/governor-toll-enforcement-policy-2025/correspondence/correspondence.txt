Toll Enforcement Policy, Vendor Oversight, and Data-Security Records

Dear OPRA Custodian,
Office of the Governor of New Jersey,

Please accept this electronic request for public records pursuant to the New Jersey Open Public Records Act (OPRA), N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1 et seq., and the common-law right of access.

Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 47:1A-6(f), this email constitutes a valid OPRA request. No agency-specific form is required.

This request is made:
	•	for public-interest and informational purposes only,
	•	not for any commercial use, and
	•	not to interfere with any pending legal proceeding.

STATEMENT OF PUBLIC INTEREST

New Jersey residents are affected by the expansion of automated toll enforcement, camera-based systems, and third-party data processing, which raise issues of public safety, due process, data protection, and government accountability.

As the State’s chief executive authority, the Governor’s Office plays a central role in policy oversight, inter-agency coordination, and response to legislative and congressional inquiries concerning such systems.

IV. LEGISLATIVE & CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRIES
	1.	All records created or received in connection with:

NON-EXISTENCE CERTIFICATION

If any category of requested records does not exist, please provide a written statement confirming:
	•	that no such records were created or maintained, and
	•	the reason for their absence.

FORMAT, FEES & RESPONSE
	•	Provide records in native electronic format where available.
	•	Redact only information specifically exempt under OPRA.
	•	Please advise in advance of any fees; I do not consent to fees exceeding $25 without approval.
	•	OPRA requires a response within seven (7) business days.

Please confirm receipt. If you are not the proper custodian, kindly forward this request and identify the correct custodian.

Respectfully,
