  NEW JERSEY OPEN PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST

Executive Clemency – Public Safety, Transparency, and Accountability

⸻

Dear Office of the Governor,

Please accept this electronic request for public records pursuant to the New Jersey Open Public Records Act (OPRA), N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1 et seq., and the common-law right of access.

Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 47:1A-6(f), an email request containing the required information constitutes a valid OPRA request. I am not required to submit an agency-specific form or use a particular software platform.

I make the following representations for clarity:
	•	This request is made for public-interest and informational purposes only.
	•	I will not use the requested records for any commercial purpose.
	•	This request is not submitted to interfere with any pending legal proceeding.

STATEMENT OF PUBLIC INTEREST

This request is submitted on behalf of New Jersey residents seeking transparency and accountability in the exercise of executive clemency — one of the most consequential powers vested in state government.

Recent gubernatorial clemency actions have included individuals convicted of serious and violent offenses, and have been issued at a scale unprecedented in modern New Jersey history. Clemency decisions directly affect:
	•	public safety and community peace,
	•	victims and their families,
	•	the integrity of sentencing and prosecutorial reliance, and
	•	public trust in government decision-making.

Residents are entitled to understand who was granted clemency, for what crimes, on what basis, and with what safeguards, particularly where government action carries real-world risk. Transparency is not hostility to reform — it is a prerequisite for lawful, legitimate governance.

SCOPE OF REQUEST

This request seeks all government records created, received, relied upon, or maintained by the Office of the Governor relating to gubernatorial clemency grants (pardons, commutations, conditional relief), including but not limited to those issued since June 2024, following the creation of the Clemency Advisory Board, and including the most recent publicly announced clemency rounds.

If responsive records are physically maintained by another agency but were relied upon by the Governor in exercising clemency authority, such records remain subject to disclosure by the Governor’s Office.
