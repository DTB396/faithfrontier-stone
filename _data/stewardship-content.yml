    Faith Frontier exists to serve neighbors through transparent documentation, faithful stewardship, 
    and accountable community building. This page is simply **me sharing products I personally use and love.** 
    If they resonate with you, wonderful—your support through these links helps sustain our mission at no extra cost to you.

    **I am not a doctor. I do not sell care, products, or services.** I'm just a neighbor sharing what has been 
    helpful in my own journey. **Please use your own discernment and always consult qualified professionals** 
    who understand your individual circumstances.
